# Learnings - Architecture Refactor

## Conventions
- RulesetId type already exists as 'gurps' | 'pf2'
- MatchState already uses rulesetId discriminant pattern
- BaseCombatantState is extended by both GURPS and PF2

## Patterns
- Discriminated unions use explicit rulesetId field
- Shape checks remain as backup (belt and suspenders approach)
- Type guards will accept unknown for ergonomic usage

## Dependencies
- Task 1 blocks Tasks 2, 3, 5
- Task 4 blocks Task 5
- All Wave 1 tasks independent
