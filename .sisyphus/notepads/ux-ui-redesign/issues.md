## [2026-01-31] Task 14 Blocker - Traits Tab Incomplete

**Issue**: Agent failed to implement Traits tab after 2 attempts (18min + 7s)
- Only changed import statements (4 lines total)
- Traits tab still shows placeholder: "Traits editor coming soon"
- Expected: Full implementation with advantages/disadvantages (GURPS) and feats (PF2)

**Impact**: Task 14 incomplete, blocking character editor completion

**Workaround**: Skipping Task 14 for now, moving to Tasks 15-16 to maintain momentum
- Traits tab can be implemented later as polish task
- Core character editing (attributes/skills/equipment) is functional

**Next Steps**: Continue with Task 15 (Pathbuilder import) and Task 16 (Character picker)
