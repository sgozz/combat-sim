# Decisions — Ruleset Lock

## Architectural Choices

### From Plan
- Ruleset chosen at registration, persisted server-side
- Server-side filtering for match lists
- Cross-ruleset join-by-code allowed (explicit intent)
- Spectating cross-ruleset allowed
- Existing users default to GURPS + toast
- Active matches stay visible when switching ruleset

(Subagents: append new decisions here)
